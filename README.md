# Triforce-Dump-Repair
A python script to repair and rename triforce dumps.

To use, give the script a path to a directory containing triforce dumps or a single dump.

Using the exe provided in the Releases is reccomended, as it does not require admin to install (some of the dependencies require Microsoft C++ Build Tools). On macOS or Linux, you can download the script (python triforcedumprepair.py).

The exe was created using pyinstaller, although some legacy py2exe code is also provided.
